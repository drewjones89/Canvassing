This project examines the work I did during the 2024 Election canvassing in Michigan's 84th State House district. 

The final report is Canvassing.html, which was created entirely in R markdown. It is also accessible in Canvassing.docx, though the html version is what my work focused on. 

See Canvassing.Rmd for analysis and visualization code. 

See Canvassing Project.xlsx for the original dataset I created.
